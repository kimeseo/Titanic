# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between **passenger class, gender, fare, and age** with survival rates on the Titanic. Using visualizations and statistical analysis, the goal is to identify key factors that influenced survival outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the **Titanic dataset**, commonly used for classification and survival analysis tasks. It contains passenger details, including:
- **Passenger Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)**
- **Fare Paid**
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Survival Status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)**

## Key Visualizations
1. **Survival Rate by Fare Range and Passenger Class**  
   - Examines how survival chances varied across different fare ranges and ticket classes.
   
2. **Survival Rate by Passenger Class**  
   - Shows the survival distribution across different classes.
   
3. **Survival Rate by Passenger Class and Gender**  
   - Highlights survival differences between males and females in each class.
   
4. **Distribution of Age by Passenger Class and Survival Status**  
   - Displays the age distribution for passengers who survived versus those who did not.
   
5. **Mean Age by Passenger Class, Gender, and Survival Status**  
   - Analyzes the average age of survivors and non-survivors in different groups.
   
6. **Mean Age by Gender and Survival Status**  
   - Compares average ages of survivors and non-survivors across gender.

## Technologies Used
- **R & RMarkdown** (`Titanic.Rmd`)
- **Data Visualization (`ggplot2`)**
- **Data Processing (`dplyr`, `tidyr`)**
- **Markdown & Pandoc** (for report generation)
